# Binder Scratchpad

This repo is set up so that it can be used with [Binder][] for [JupyterLab real-time collaboration][jl-rtc].

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nick-ulle/binder-scratchpad/HEAD)

[Binder]: https://mybinder.org/
[jl-rtc]: https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/rtc.html

Want to set up your own repo like this?

1. Set up a repo for [Binder][]. I learned how from [the Zero-to-Binder chapter in The Turing Way][ztb].
2. Configure the repo to enable JupyterLab RTC. I learned how from [this gist][jtpio-gist].

[ztb]: https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/communication/binder/zero-to-binder.html
[jtpio-gist]: https://gist.github.com/jtpio/6ce26381703355e0ef1da4af742b7f72

It's also possible to set up JupyterLab RTC without Binder, but it's a bit more difficult and has potential security risks.
